A list of my personal favorite VS Code extensions

## [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)

This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. The user can define which characters to match, and which colours to use.
